Picture Roulette is a game of chance that uses the Twilio and Flickr APIs. 
Flickr's tags are only as accurate as the humans who apply them to photos. 

This program was originally designed to query a tag for a relevant picture. 
What we didn't expect is that Flickr users' use of tags would be so diverse 
and often nonsensical. Hence, the MMS Picture Roulette game was born!


## How to play
Text a one-word query to your Twilio number from any texting device. Wait 
30 seconds (or less), and receive your photo. 

Does the photo match your query? You win. 

Is the photo totally random? Everyone else playing wins (yes, this means you
lose).
